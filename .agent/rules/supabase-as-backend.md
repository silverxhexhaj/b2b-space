This project uses supabase for tables for fetching queries and such
For supabase documenation use https://supabase.com/docs
Need to store a copie of the queries locally.
The important stuff will be tables name and supabase database function.
Moreover i need also a typescript client for the tables used so i can use the same types in the frontend application.
